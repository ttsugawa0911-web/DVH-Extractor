DVH Extractor: A DVH Data Tool for Varian Eclipse
DVH Extractor is a desktop application designed to efficiently extract and organize essential data from Dose-Volume Histogram (DVH) text files generated by the Varian Eclipse treatment planning system. It automates the batch processing of multiple DVH files, converting them into a clean CSV format that's ready for analysis and research.

With this tool, you can eliminate the tedious task of manual data entry and avoid the complexity of writing custom scripts. Its intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows you to easily retrieve data in the following formats:

Patient-wise: Consolidates a single patient's DVH data into one CSV file.

Structure-wise: Collects the DVH data for a specific structure (e.g., a tumor or an organ) across all patients into a single CSV file.

Key Features
Batch processes DVH files exported from Varian Eclipse.

Extracts data at a user-defined sampling interval and dose type (% or Gy).

Outputs results as CSV files, organized either by patient or by structure.

Performs time-consuming tasks in the background, ensuring the GUI remains responsive.

Automatically saves and restores the last-used folder settings.

Whether you are involved in research, quality assurance, or clinical data analysis, this tool will be an invaluable asset for anyone working with DVH data.
